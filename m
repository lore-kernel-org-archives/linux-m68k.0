Handling the IDE interrupt first I think, then looking at the DMA (for
SCSI or FDC).

libata dropped the locking (and does not use IDE interrupts at present
so it seems to be safe. Still testing - I've seen IO errors, and that's
a bit of a worry).

I need to think about that some more - if no DMA is in progress we can
safely peek at the SCSI registers. So the logic could be changed to test
for DMA operation first, and just try and service the interrupt if DMA
wasn't active.

If DMA has been in progress, I'm not sure that we can figure out if it's
still active from looking at the status register (that is, whether bits
0 or 1 are set while DMA is ongoing). We'd have to peek at the DMA
status register (or DMA address registers) without first stopping DMA,
which the current driver does. The docs seem to advise against that.
If DMA was in progress, stopping it would likely leave us with residual
bytes to be transferred - we'd have to handle that transfer as we would
any other DMA error (from memory, probably best to retry the entire
command, or transfer the remaining bytes using PIO if we're sure no
bytes have been lost).

Yes, SCSI can work using PIO but's it a real dog. Been there, done that
(about 20 years ago). I know nothing about the FDC chip though.

I'll reread the ST-DMA description (and the FDC one).

Let me know if you think this could work ...

Cheers,
