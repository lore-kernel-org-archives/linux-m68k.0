As far as I can see this works and makes sense.

I think they are just there to cut down on the available menu choices
when doing manual configuration. Which is moot since the machine/subarch
likely selects the right clocksource driver anyway.

About ARM:

For ARM we now have two subarchs not using generic clockevents:
RISC PC and EBSA110.

I think Russell stated these two cannot be converted to generic clockevents
because of hardware limitations I guess, no timer interrupt, simply, which
means no clockevents, or unreliable or not granular enough timers.

IIUC the SA110 does not contain the built-in SoC goodies of the SA1100
so it needs external timer blocks, and those two machines don't have
good enough timers.

That is a bit annoying since even the Commodore 64 has good enough
timers to run generic clock events, had it only had compiler support
and enough memory to run Linux...

Anyways, I'm too ignorant to even fully understand what happens
on a system with just GETTIMEOFFSET and not clockevents, does the
OS just run in an eternal loop and advancing any event in the system
using that time offset?

Yours,
