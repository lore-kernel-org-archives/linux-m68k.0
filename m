At this point I just booted an alpha image and on qemu-system-alpha.

I do have gdb in my kernel image so I can test that.  I haven't yet but
I can and should.

Sleeping on it I came up with a plan to add TF_SWITCH_STACK_SAVED to
indicate if the registers have been saved.  The DO_SWITCH_STACK and
UNDO_SWITCH_STACK helpers (except in alpha_switch_to) can test that.
The ptrace helpers can test that and turn an access of random kernel
stack contents into something well behaved that does WARN_ON_ONCE
because we should not get there.

I suspect adding TF_SWITCH_STACK_SAVED should come first so it
is easy to verify the problem behavior, before I fix it.

My real goal is to find a pattern that architectures whose register
saves are structured like alphas can emulate, to minimize problems in
the future.

Plus I would really like to get the last handful of architectures
updated so we can remove CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_TRACEHOOK.  I think we can
do that on alpha because we save all of the system call arguments
in pt_regs and that is all the other non-ptrace code paths care about.

AKA I am trying to move the old architectures forward so we can get rid
of unnecessary complications in the core code.

Eric
