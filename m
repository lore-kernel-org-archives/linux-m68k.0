They have different goals -- the main purpose of ack_intr() (despite its name)
seems to be testing whether the IRQ is ours, OTOH in clear_irq() we know that
already and we just want to clear the pending IRQ status.

So I'm not sure if unification is desirable... though some improvements are
definitely possibly there (less confusing naming at least)...

Good question, m68k list would be the best place to look for an answer..
