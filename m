Turns out that is harder than it looked at first glance (at least for me).

All syscalls that _do_ save the switch stack are currently called 
through wrappers which pull the syscall arguments out of the saved 
pt_regs on the stack (pushing the switch stack after the SAVE_ALL saved 
stuff buries the syscall arguments on the stack, see comment about 
m68k_clone(). We'd have to push the switch stack _first_ when entering 
system_call to leave the syscall arguments in place, but that will 
require further changes to the syscall exit path (currently shared with 
the interrupt exit path). Not to mention the register offset 
calculations in arch/m68k/kernel/ptrace.c, and perhaps a few other 
dependencies that don't come to mind immediately.

We have both pt_regs and switch_stack in uapi/asm/ptrace.h, but the 
ordering of the two is only mentioned in a comment. Can we reorder them 
on the stack, as long as we don't change the struct definitions proper?

This will take a little more time to work out and test - certainly not 
before the weekend. I'll send a corrected version of my debug patch 
before that.

Cheers,

     Michael
