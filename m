Thanks, that looks entirely reasonable.

That comment is probably incorrect in part. Blame Linus :-)

Seriously though - that comment dates back to the dark ages (when m68k
was an entirely separate port and the IDE driver was indeed named
falhd.c). That would have been even before 2.2 or 2.4 times. The
comment just never got updated.

What is still correct is that the IDE driver does use the interrupt
only, not the ST-DMA chip. And a single IDE interrupt can be correctly
assigned to IDE by looking at the status register.

With the SCSI (and IIRC also floppy) interrupts, we don't have direct
access to the status registers without disturbing the state of the DMA
though. Unless we know for definite that either chips have raised the
interrupt (and DMA ops are in flight), we must not touch the DMA chip
at all.

The case I'm worried about is both IDE and SCSI raising an interrupt.
We don't currently mask the IDE/ST-DMA interrupt so a stacked
interrupt must be processed in the same pass as the initial interrupt
or it will get dropped. We'd have to peek at the DMA registers to
check the SCSI or floppy interrupt status, and we just can't safely do
that. So races of this kind are currently prevented by including IDE
in the IRQ locking process.

Whether it's possible to mask the interrupt, do one pass, unmask and
process the second interrupt I don't know. Maybe Andreas does?

Cheers,

  Michael
