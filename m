Not necessarily. It might work fine for the subset of machines that
use that code.
But generic code should use the masks - even if they are set to ~0UL.

Verify or enforce that the physical memory is allocated from a memory
pool suitable for
use by that device. If any bits "stick out" from the address (vs the
mask), the device
won't be able to DMA to that address and very likely truncate the addre=
ss.

By default the PCI dma_mask is 32-bits. Drivers that can support more
than 32-bits
(some PCI, most PCI-X and all PCI-E devices) will be calling pci_set_dm=
a_mask()
and pci_set_coherent_dma_mask() or the equivalent DMA API call.

pci-dma.c ignores it for the same reason it ignores coherent_dma_mask.
None of those parisc machines have host memory at a physical address th=
at is NOT
reachable via DMA by *all* known/supported devices.

Maybe it's ok and we just need a comment stating the constraints of
the generic code.

And there must be some way (e.g. dma_support()) to verify the highest p=
hysical
memory location is reachable by the given device. So that would be anot=
her way
to enforce the mask.

> Should dma_map_* just fail in case of an address exceeding dma_mask?

That would probably be correct behavior too. But my gut feeling is we d=
on't want
the device driver module to load unless we know the device can DMA to
any possible host memory location handed to dma_map_single().
My preference is the initialization path fail first. dma_alloc_coherent=
()
is generally in the initialization path after the drivers call pci_set*=
mask().

That's what I expected. I'm pretty sure parisc could use a generic
implementation
for PA7100LC and PA7300LC CPUs (other parisc CPUs/memory controllers do=
n't
support uncached mappings to host memory). So we would need run-time de=
tection
and set dma_ops appropriately.

Ok - cool!
