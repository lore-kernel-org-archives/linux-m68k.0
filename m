The problem is that on m68k size of the struct module_version_attribute
is not evenly divisible by sizeof(void *), thus when we lay out the
__modver section we align on 4 bytes but when we iterate we think that
the alignment is 2.

I/Geert tried adding __attribute__ (aligned(sizeof(void *))) to the type
definition itself so we have matching alignment everywhere, but DaveM
said that this only guarantees minimum alignment and that using
structures like we do shown to break from time to time in kprobes and
that only pointers worked reliably.

Thanks.
