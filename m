Yeah, I have no problem with that.

At the moment though setup.c is a basic stub with only this in it:

    #ifdef CONFIG_MMU
    #include "setup_mm.c"
    #else
    #include "setup_no.c"
    #endif

It is one of the very few files remaining that we have not fully
re-merged from the original MMU and no-MMU versions.

Maybe its time we looked at cleaning this up as well...

Greg
