Right.

I think the temporary variables can remain 'fres', as that's just a 
mnemonic, though the declaration really ought to tell us something 
meaningful.

You and I both avoided 'func' as an abbreviation. I think it suggests a 
'C' function pointer. And 'res' and 'rsrc' suggest an ioport.h struct 
resource. An unambiguous compromise would be 'nubus_functional_rsrc' but 
maybe this is still too long?

Perhaps 'struct nubus_rsrc' or 'struct nubus_res' are okay if we can keep 
the distinction between 'functional resources', 'slot resources' and 
'board resources' clear by naming instances appropriately? E.g.
