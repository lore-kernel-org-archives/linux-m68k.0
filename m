Would that require handling the SCSI DMA interrupt in the first pass? Or 
handling IDE first, and ensuring that the IDE handler does not access 
ST-DMA registers? What about FDC?

The atari_scsi handler accesses the ST-DMA registers; it can do so because 
it knows that any DMA must have completed -- it can infer this because a 
simultaneous pending interrupt from FDC or IDE is impossible due to 
stdma_lock().

Your suggestion would seem to allow other pending interrupts, hence the 
atari_scsi interrupt handler logic has to be tossed out. What logic would 
replace it?

If all else fails, perhaps we could inhibit DMA entirely when the new ATA 
driver is loaded. Then we can just dispatch the ST-DMA irq like a shared 
irq. I'm sure that atari_scsi can work without DMA. No idea about the FDC 
driver though (ataflop.c).

Another solution would be to dedicate the DMA function to atari_scsi, and 
then mask the FDC and IDE interrupts during each DMA transfer. But once 
again, this would mean changing the FDC driver to eliminate DMA, if that 
is possible. From the schematic it looks the the FDC chip, "AJAX", is 
another custom ...

Unfortunately my grasp of the ST hardware reflects my inability to read 
German; those who can may want to take a look at "ATARI Profibuch 
ST-STE-TT.pdf".
