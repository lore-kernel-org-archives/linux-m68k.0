So everyone is in the loop - I have pulled this into my for-linus branch
at https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/gerg/m68knommu.git/ ,
excepting patch 15 (ARM specific changes).

My continued testing hasn't found any issues on m68k platforms.
I can completely boot up with a no-MMU user space and run on an
MMU enabled ColdFire platform).

I'll like to consider pushing this to Linus nearer the end of the
merge window if no-one has any objections.

Regards
Greg
