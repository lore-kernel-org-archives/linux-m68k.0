I was alluding to the assertion that "USER_DS is the normal operating 
state": https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/1/15/476

Thanks. I gather that you don't need this patch on s390 any more. Though 
it does promise to save some cycles on any architecture that can optimize 
away all the "if (!futex_cmpxchg_enabled) return" tests.

With your patch, the nak'd patch* from Geert would be obsolete unless it 
was useful to mips (or deemed correct by fiat).
