Might also just be because the m68k port had been dead in Debian for a
while due the lack of TLS support in glibc on m68k. However, the port
is active again and in pretty good shape now.

I'm currently working on fixing debian-installer on m68k, so that
people can install the port without having to resort to things like
debootstrap.

Thanks! Highly appreciated.

Ooooh, that would be awesome. If you need any testers on m68k, please
let us know. I have plenty of m68k hardware for testing.

No idea whether it's feasible. But it sounds awesome :).
