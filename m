But OTOH, this is an old problem which was faced by module params since
pre-git.  And we use the-align-to-void*-size method there; I vaguely recall
inserting it.

You've now got me wondering whether these platforms have broken builtin
module parameters, but I think it would crash iterating if you had any
boot parameters at all if that were the case.

So do we fix that now too, or wait for it to break?
Rusty.
