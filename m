The raw accessors are always assumed to be non-swapping
in the asm-generic code, while the non-raw ones are assumed to
be little-endian in order for them to work with portable drivers.

We have some other cases of big-endian machines that use
a hardware byteswap on their MMIO buses (iirc some mips
and superh parts), but they then need to swap the __raw_*
accessor data words in software to get back to the normal
behavior, as well as swizzle the address for accesses that are
less than 32 bit wide.

Coldfire makes the behavior of readw()/readl() depend on the
MMIO address, presumably since that was the easiest way to
get drivers working originally, but it breaks the assumption
in the asm-generic code.

I would expect that the compiler is capable of detecting a double
swap and optimize it out. Even if it can't, there are not that many
instances of io{read,write}{16,32}be in the kernel, so the increase
in kernel image size from a double swap should be limited to a
few extra instructions, and the runtime overhead should be
negligible compared to the bus access.

Yes, that should be the easiest workaround. I doubt that anyone
would want to audit all drivers for internal I/O on coldfire and
convert them to use the big-endian accessors in place of the
readw/readl ones in order to use the asm-generic/io.h conventions.
