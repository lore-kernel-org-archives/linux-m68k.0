Hi Wolfram,

Thanks for your input!

Yes, but it also determines the frequency of the oscillator driving the PCF8584. It doesn't usually need to be touched, the current setting drives at the maximum I2C bus speed, with the maximum oscillator (12 MHz).
I kept it in because i2c-elektor also exposes it in the same way, and it seems useful.

Thanks, I'll drop it.

True. Dropped, thanks.

Thanks! I'll change it to "GPL v2", but unfortunately there is no option for "only" in include/linux/module.h.


Cheers
