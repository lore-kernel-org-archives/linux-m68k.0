Hello,

I just completed a test build with my patch to arch/m68k/Makefile to remove the -pipe flag (see patch below).  
Watching the build confirmed that a) -pipe was no longer showing up in the gcc command lines and b) temporary 
files were being created as expected without pipe; and c) the as command was not loaded waiting for cc1 to 
complete.  Yea!  The /arch/m68k/Makefile is the only place where the -pipe flag is located, and that seems
to be the place for all arch's.

Pulling out the -pipe does seem to cut compile time.  I am working on hard numbers.
