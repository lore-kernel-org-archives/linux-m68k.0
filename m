I have been digging into this some more and I have found one place
that I am having a challenge dealing with.

In arch/m68k/fpsp040/skeleton.S there is an assembly version of
copy_from_user that calls fpsp040_die when the bytes can not be read.

Now fpsp040_die is just:

/*
 * This function is called if an error occur while accessing
 * user-space from the fpsp040 code.
 */
asmlinkage void fpsp040_die(void)
{
	do_exit(SIGSEGV);
}


The problem here is the instruction emulation performed in the fpsp040
code performs a very minimal saving of registers.  I don't think even
the normal system call entry point registers that are saved are present
at that point.

Is there any chance you can help me figure out how to get a stack frame
with all of the registers present before fpsp040_die is called?

Eric
