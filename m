Hrm, that's not ideal.  It'd be nice if it were able to do something
like always reply if there were patch contents, or if it found things
like the KernelVersion line in there.  Obviously e-mail is also not time
guaranteed so deciding it's not responded (and then working out why it
did that) is going to be unreliable too.

I do recall seeing the patch in the database but it's not showing up any
more so perhaps I was thinking of a different patch.

OK, that's what I'd thought was going on - it was the fact that you'd
just acked the patch rather than asked for it to go to the patch tracker
or something which made me wonder if things had changed.
