It's simply specifying alignment when declaring the variable that
prevents this optimisation. The relevant code is in the function
align_variable() in [1] where DATA_ALIGNMENT() is never called in case
an alignment has been specified (!DECL_USER_ALIGN(decl)).

There's no mention in the documentation of this that I'm aware of, but
this is the way the aligned attribute has worked since its introduction
judging from the commit history.

As mentioned above, we've been relying on this for kernel parameters and
other structures since 2003-2004 so if it ever were to change we'd find
out soon enough.

It's about to be used for scheduler classes as well. [2]
