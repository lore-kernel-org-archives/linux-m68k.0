The first delay can even be quite long, estimated based on the transfer
size.

We could do that as well, true. Easier to implement on the quick.

Quite right - that's why I mentioned monitoring the IRQ signal status in
the GPIO register.

Looping over the handlers risks stopping the DMA without need (except
for IDE).

The initial bus reset code had safeguards against raising an interrupt -
the IRQ was 'turned off' while the bus reset was executed. Maybe we need
something like that, at least in the case where SCSI does not hold the
ST-DMA lock.

Whilst the IDE interrupt is the only one pending, to be precise.

Not quite - we can't be certain that there aren't actually two
interrupts pending (say IDE interrupts first, and while we service that
interrupt, SCSI interrupts next but since the IRQ signal remains low, we
don't trigger another interrupt). So we must run the loop for both IDE
and stdma_int for as long as the IRQ signal remains low.

I had missed the case where SCSI interrupts first and the IDE interrupt
only comes in while the SCSI inthandler is running - need to think a bit
more about this.

I've written a function to that effect, and tested it in the current
Falcon inthandler (without sharing the interrupt truly yet).

We can never have both SCSI and FDC interrupt at the same time (both
register access and DMA setup are shared between the two). Best retain
stdma_lock() for these two.

Correct - polled DMA might be easier to handle here.

Meaning likely to race...

I'll have to test this with IDE removed from the locking scheme, and
we'll hopefully see races pretty quick.

Got a few new ideas to try now, thanks!
