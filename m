No.  The function do_exit never returns.

If it is not too much difficulty I would be in favor of having the code
do force_sigsegv(SIGSEGV), instead of calling do_exit directly.

Looking at that code I have not been able to figure out the call paths
that get into skeleton.S.  I am not certain saving all of the registers
on an the exceptions that reach there make sense.  In practice I suspect
taking an exception is much more expensive than saving the registers so it
might not make any difference.  But this definitely looks like code that
is performance sensitive.

My sense when I was reading through skeleton.S was just one or two
registers were saved before the instruction emulation was called.
