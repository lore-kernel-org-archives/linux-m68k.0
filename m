Well, the other option is to remove it, and then add it back once somebody complains - which is unlikely to happen. The clock parameter is PCF8584 specific anyway, and  I think removing it is a good option, as I've done the same with getown() (where in i2c-elektor, 'own' sets the PCF8584's own address).

Question is, if I remove the parameter, I'd like it to be non-destructive. Do you know of anything that can go wrong if the I2C master is running the bus on a wrong clock?


Thanks
