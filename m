        ^^^^^^^^^^

I don't think this saves the registers in the well known fixed location
on the stack because some registers are saved at the exception entry
point.

Without being saved at the well known fixed location if some process
stops in PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT in do_exit we likely get some complete
gibberish.

That is probably safe.

Especially as everything after jumping to fpsp040_die does not execute.
