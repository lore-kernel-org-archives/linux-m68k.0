DMA contends with the processor use of the data bus but that's true for
many DMA designs. Don't think Atari made any more dumb decisions (the
opaque DMA FIFO is probably the worst feature there but that could be
worked around at considerable expense by programming the DMA and the
SCSI bus transfer for one additional 512 byte block. Let's not go there.)

But how much more overhead would we have compared to using the SCSI
interrupt to signal DMA completion?

I think that's infeasible - IDE interrupts could be disabled at disk
level as Geert suggests but I don't think there is a kernel API for
other drivers to do so?

At the IRQ controller level, it's all or none due to the wired-OR design
as you pointed out in the reply to Geert's mail.

The libata driver currently does disable the IDE interrupt and uses
polling, but I'd like to change that if at all possible. Sorry I didn't
make that clear.

As far as I could see during my testing, the current libata driver
coexists just fine with interrupt driven SCSI operation. I've once seen
a 'lost arbitration' message in the very first test when loading the
SCSI driver, but that's not been repeated. No problems seen otherwise.

I was assuming IDE could have interrupts reenabled in libata for that
discussion.

Since IDE does not use the ST-DMA and does not share any registers with
ST-DMA, peeking at the IDE status register in order to decide whether
the interrupt was raised by the IDE interface won't hurt the running DMA
process (regardless of whether FDC or SCSI started it). Nor will
servicing the IDE interrupt.

If at the end of the IDE interrupt processing the interrupt status is
cleared in the IDE interface, the interrupt line should go high again
before the IDE inthandler returns.

If we can ensure that the FDC/SCSI interrupt handler runs after the IDE
handler, we can then make that handler check the interrupt line status
and bail out if there's nothing to be done. (For the sake of simplicity,
this check can be done in stdma_int() since we need to retain mutual
locking of the DMA interface by SCSI and FDC anyway.) We can ensure the
IDE interrupt is called first by using a special interrupt controller to
register separate IDE and FDC/SCSI interrupts with (I've done that to
provide distinct interrupt numbers and handlers for the timer D
interrupt that's used to poll ethernet and USB interface status on the
ROM port).

That way, we can ensure IDE interrupts do not step on the ST-DMA state,
and all that remains are premature SCSI interrupts terminating DMA
transfer (which we already face anyway).

Am I missing a potential race here? Does IDE send the next request off
to the disk from inside the interrupt handler so we could see IDE
immediately raise the next interrupt?  In that case, we'd also need to
check the IDE interrupt status in the interface status register, and
bail out for another pass through the IDE/FDC/SCSI handlers until IDE is
no longer posting an interrupt...

Cheers,

	Michael
