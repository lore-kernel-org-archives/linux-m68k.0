We still have nios2 which copied the m68k logic at some point.  I think
that is a processor that is still ``shipping'' and that people might
still be using in new designs.

I haven't looked closely enough to see what the other architectures with
caller saved registers are doing.

The challenging ones are /proc/pid/syscall and seccomp which want to see
all of the system call arguments.  I think every architecture always
saves the system call arguments unconditionally, so those cases are
probably not as interesting.  But they certain look like they could be
trouble.
