I had to update ret_from_kernel_thread to pop that state to get Linus's
change to boot.  Apparently kernel_threads exiting needs to be handled.

Which does not work because nios2 which looks susceptible
sets CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_TRACEHOOK.

A further look shows that there is also PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC that
needs to be handled so execve and execveat need to be wrapped
as well.

Do you happen to know if there is userspace that will run
in qemu-system-m68k that can be used for testing?
