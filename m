OK, I'll do dynamic platform device allocation.

I guess link order (arch before drivers) saves you here but it is not
very clean.

We explicitly do q40kbd_stop() before requesting IRQ. Frankly serio
will be stopped by the serio core (via serio->stop() which is
q40kbd_stop()) so freeing IRQ fisrt should be fine, it just was looking
scary. I'll revert the order and add a comment.
