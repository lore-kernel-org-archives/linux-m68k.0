So we have https://lore.kernel.org/all/87bko3ia88.fsf@igel.home ;-)

And the other issue is m68k strcmp() calls being dropped by the
optimizer, cfr. the discussion in
https://lore.kernel.org/all/b673f98db7d14d53a6e1a1957ef81741@AcuMS.aculab.com

Thanks, commit fb63362c63c7aeac ("lib: fix buggy strcmp and strncmp") in
v2023.01-rc1, which is not yet in a released version.
(and in plain C, not in asm ;-)
