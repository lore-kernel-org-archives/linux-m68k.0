For the sake of discussion, I'll assume that the FDC driver will not be 
using DMA. (Perhaps FDC and SCSI can share the ST-DMA chip, using the 
present locking mechanism, but it would not simplify things much: when IDE 
no longer participates in that locking mechanism then both FDC and SCSI 
drivers have to solve the same issues.)

What compiler are you using, BTW? Are you still using the gcc-4.6.3 m68k 
cross-compiler from kernel.org? I had to abandon it in order to get my 
SCSI driver patches to work.

OK, so based on the above, we handle the possible IDE interrupt (without 
checking DMA registers), handle the possible FDC interrupt (again without 
checking DMA registers) and finally handle the possible SCSI interrupt.

The core 5380 driver knows whether or not it has started a DMA. The 
atari_scsi driver also knows that no other Falcon driver uses DMA. So the 
atari_scsi handler only has to figure out whether the interrupt was 
asserted by the ST-DMA chip or the 5380 chip, or neither. (The "neither" 
possility arises when IDE ditches the the stdma.c lock mechanism.)

Without the stdma.c lock, any or all of these interrupts could be asserted 
simultaneously, so the IDE and FDC drivers need to be able to do the right 
thing in the presence of the other interrupts and do so without accessing 
the ST-DMA chip. And the SCSI interrupt handler needs to do the right 
thing when there is no DMA interrupt, and yet a DMA is running.

Perhaps we could reverse the algorithm in scsi_falcon_intr(): if 
NCR5380_intr() completes with IRQ_HANDLED and the core 5380 driver is no 
longer in DMA, then check the ST-DMA registers for errors etc.

Alternatively, if NCR5380_intr() returns IRQ_NONE, then do nothing at all, 
on the basis that the interrupt was handled by FDC or IDE. In this 
situation, I gather that atari_scsi could miss out on a DMA completion 
interrupt from the ST-DMA chip, which could lead to command timeout?

I can't comment on the Profibuch doc or the ST-DMA chip details (Andreas?)

I suspect it has to be tried.

Allowing the command to fail should be fine so long as the 5380 driver 
sends the correct result code to the mid-layer. To attempt to complete the 
command after a failed DMA is needless complexity, and it's a trick that 
probably can't be pulled off reliably anyway.
