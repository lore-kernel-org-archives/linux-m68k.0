The callback, just like getclock(), is from the existing i2c-algo-pcf, which I don't want to touch right now. So I'm afraid it has to stay, even if it returns a fixed number.

Touching or forking i2c-algo-pcf will be necessary in order to implement IRQ support, if I ever get around to it. I've wasted too much time on debugging IRQ support, and would rather do it another time, if ever ;)
I've left a comment block at the start of i2c-icy.c for anyone interested in the gory details.


If this is okay with you, I'll send another round of patches. :)


Thanks!

Max
