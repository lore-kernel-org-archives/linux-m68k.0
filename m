No, you should call flush_tlb_kernel_range() and just fix up the
flush_tlb_kernel_range() calls to wrap in to flush_tlb_kernel_page(). As
far as the kernel is concerned, flush_tlb_kernel_page() is not a standard
interface, as it has no mention in Documentation/cachetlb.txt.
flush_tlb_page() and flush_tlb_kernel_range() on the other hand are both
standard interfaces.

H8300 is a nommu platform, so it has no TLB to flush. Yoshinori Sato is
the maintainer. Consult the MAINTAINERS file, that's what it is there for.
