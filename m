	Hi,

This patch series adds missing initialization of max_pfn, min_low_pfn,
and max_low_pfn on various m68k platforms.

This was exposed by failing selftests/vm/mlock2-tests.

Note that several other architectures lack a proper initialization of
max_pfn. On some of them it's completely missing, on others max_pfn is a
local variable, hence it hides the global max_pfn, which is thus not
initialized neither.

On platforms with MMU, this can easily be verified by reading the
following virtual files (CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR=y):

    /proc/kpagecount
    /proc/kpageflags
    /proc/kpagecgroup (CONFIG_MEMCG=y)

If max_pfn is not initialized, all three virtual files are empty.

Besides the above, max_pfn is also used to calculate DMA masks for block
devices. An uninitialized (zero) value means all RAM is suitable for
DMA.

Absence of initialization of min_low_pfn and max_low_pfn is more subtle.
(are there any bad side-effects?).

Geert Uytterhoeven (4):
  m68k/mm: motorola - Add missing initialization of max_pfn
  m68k/mm: m54xx - Add missing initialization of max_pfn
  m68k/mm: sun3 - Add missing initialization of max_pfn and
    {min,max}_low_pfn
  m68knommu: Add missing initialization of max_pfn and {min,max}_low_pfn
