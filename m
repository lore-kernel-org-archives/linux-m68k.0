Do we want coredumps from processes that use io_uring? yes
Exactly what we want from io_uring threads is less clear.  We can't
really give much that is meaningful beyond the thread ids of the
io_uring threads.

What problems do are you seeing beyond the missing registers on the
stack for kernel threads?

I don't immediately see the connection between coredumps and de_thread.

The function de_thread arranges for the fatal_signal_pending to be true,
and that should work just fine for io_uring threads.  The io_uring
threads process the fatal_signal with get_signal and then proceed to
exit eventually calling do_exit.
