Sure, why not?

A polled DMA transfer should be faster than PDMA (i.e. mac_scsi, g_NCR5380 
etc). mac_scsi gets about 0.5 MBps from PDMA with sg_tablesize == 1, and I 
hope that DMA could get twice that (notwithstanding dumb hardware design). 

This would imply CPU overhead that is half of that which mac_scsi incurs. 
That's the best case, but I see no reason to expect worse performance than 
PDMA gets.

The difficulty will be arranging for disabled FDC & IDE interrupt sources 
during SCSI DMA, and disabled SCSI & IDE interrupt sources during FDC DMA. 
(Not all 5380 interrupts can be disabled; no idea about the IDE device or 
WD1772 FDC.)

But if that is impossible, we just have to detect the short DMA that might 
result from an undesired interrupt.

There are no interrupts from the ATA driver you're testing, right? If you 
would re-introduce them, the whole polled DMA idea is moot.

The ATA driver will never have to cope with a spurious interrupt under my 
simplifying assumptions discussed earlier, so the spurious interrupt 
question seems to belong to some alternative approach...

... "Both ways"? I don't follow. I don't see how IDE can share the FDC and 
SCSI interrupt line without sharing the stdma.c locking scheme. What is 
the alternative approach (i.e not polled DMA) that you alude to?
