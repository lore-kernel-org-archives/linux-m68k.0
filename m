That's what needs to happen.  We provide no-op functions for e.g. PCI 
and x86 DMI, for platforms where this support does not exist.

Pretty much all architectures support some form of ATA.  m68k, m32r, 
h8300 and microblaze all have IDE interface, which means that libata 
needs to work on that platform.

The only !ATA arch in the entire kernel is s390, AFAICT.
