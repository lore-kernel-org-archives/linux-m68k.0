I said abouve "I've merged it" - that means, I've put it in my
tree...

Hmm, it's possible I didn't push the tree out... well, I have done so
now, so it should be visible from tonight onwards and should be in
-next sometime during the next couple of days (it seems to take a
couple of days between me pushing stuff out one evening to stuff
appearing in -next because of the timezones and timing of sfr's pulls.)
