Thanks, looks great!

(my first thought a few days ago was "Oh no, we're changing to the correct
padding for e.g. time_t", but apparently the asm-generic versions do it wrong
on big endian platforms, too ;-)

Do you plan to resubmit for the uapi header changes I have already queued?
Or shall I try to rebase it myself, using Stephen's fix?
Note that termios.h now needs 2 changes, as it's split in uapi and normal
(kernel use only).

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
