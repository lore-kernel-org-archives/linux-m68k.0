Correct - IIRC the FDC registers are also accessible 'through' the
ST-DMA registers only so the same problem WRT DMA status arises.

4.6.3 is the version I still use. You had trouble with that one? I
recall some discussion on gcc versions on the m68k list a while back,
just never seemed to see any problems...

No, we can't check either FDC or SCSI interrupts (or indeed any chip
registers) without touching the ST-DMA. The moment we select a FDC or
SCSI register for read, DMA is terminated no questions asked.

Again, whenever DMA was running (and it might still be), we have to stop
it in order to look at FDC or SCSI registers. Utter braindamage, but

We may only call NCR5380_intr() if DMA hadn't been active (or we are
sure it's completed, i.e. transfer address == end address. If that's
even possible). If the DMA is still ongoing, we have the choice of
punting (hoping for a command timeout to happen and clean up the mess),
or terminate DMA (by selecting the SCSI chip registers instead of the
DMA ones) and deal with the fallout.

Doing nothing if DMA is enabled (and IDE had successfully handled an
interrupt!) would cause us to miss a stacked interrupt, yes. Timeout
would likely ensue. Not sure it's wise to kludge around that using a
watchdog timer activated in case we're not sure of the DMA completion
state...

Yes, I fear I'll have to just try what happens if SCSI and IDE raise an
interrupt at the same time.

For now, polled IDE might be working well enough (haven't seen a huge
impact in IDE-only test workloads, I'll have to check impact on lots of
seeks across the whole disk a lot harder though). I need to recheck the
old IDE driver with my current combined test workload though (my second
4 GB Seagate disk has finally kicked the bucket, after the latest power
brownout).

Yep, we've been there before (when my CT60 caused SCSI DMA errors and
lost bytes). Not sure anymore what the correct result code was...
