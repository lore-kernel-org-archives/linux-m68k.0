Note that the patch system doesn't always return error messages anymore
(it used to do that reliably, but as it's now a favourite target for
spammers and was creating soo much backscatter, which was then filling
my mailbox with bounces... that had to change.)

However, it will always return a message for a patch that it adds to the
database, so if you don't get that then it means something went wrong
somewhere and you should check to see whether it exists in the database
in case it's the emailed response which got lost.

Email today still remains an unreliable transmission medium - there is
no guarantee that any message sent will get to its destination, and in
the same way, there is no guarantee that any acknowledgement (or NDR)
will get back to the originator.

Well, in theory I'm the maintainer for clkdev and clk API, so I should
take the patch...
