For do_exit the part we need to be careful with is PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT,
which means it is ptrace that we need to look at.

For m68k the code in put_reg and get_reg finds the registers by looking
at task->thread.esp0.

I was expecting m68k to use the same technique as alpha which expects a
fixed offset from task_stack_page(task).

So your code will work if you add code to update task->thread.esp0 which
is also known as THREAD_ESP0 in entry.S

Yes.  I think we would probably need to have it also call get_signal and
all of that, because I don't think the very light call path for that
exception includes testing if signals are pending.

The way the code is structured it is actively incorrect to return from
fpsp040_die, as the code does not know what to do if it reads a byte
from userspace and there is nothing there.

So instead of handling -EFAULT like most pieces of kernel code the code
just immediately calls do_exit, and does not even attempt to handle
the error.

That is not my favorite strategy at all, but I suspect it isn't worth
it, or safe to update the skeleton.S to handle errors.  Especially as we
have not even figured out how to test that code yet.
