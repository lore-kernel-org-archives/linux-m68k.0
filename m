Hi Michael.

Hmm, I think they just went for prettier URLs:

https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/RDB

But there is not much on it.


Not sure whether there is a more detailed explanation anywhere on the 
net. I am pretty sure there is more in the NDK/SDK tough. And indeed 
there is:

AmigaOS 3.x NDK

https://www.hyperion-entertainment.com/index.php/downloads?
view=files&parent=40

I found it in: Include_H/devices/hardblocks.h

This is at least an include with the exact structure of the RDB and of 
the partition blocks. There are some explanations in the comments. Maybe 
there is something more elsewhere in this NDK.

You can unpack this using lhasa, easily available in Debian based 
distributions.

AmigaOS 4.x Software Development Kit

https://www.hyperion-entertainment.com/index.php/downloads?
view=files&parent=30

This is a bit more time consuming to dig through. I skip it for now.

Best,
