My suggestion is to not touch i2c-elektor at all for now, and remove the 'clock' parameter from the first iteration of i2c-icy. It can be added back in case someone complains, which I deem unlikely.

Yes it can, but this driver does not implement this.

In fact, I just remembered that the own address, while set, is not used at all in master mode!

Quote from the datasheet:
https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/PCF8584.pdf

  6.4 Own address register S0'

  When the PCF8584 is addressed as slave, this register
  must be loaded with the 7-bit I 2 C-bus address to which the
  PCF8584 is to respond. During initialization, the own
  address register S0' must be written to, regardless
  whether it is later used.

Okay, so we don't care. Cool, then it's safe to kick the 'clock' parameter from i2c-icy. All 2019 boards (which should be the vast majority in existence) came with a 12 MHz oscillator AFAIK, so the default should be good.
