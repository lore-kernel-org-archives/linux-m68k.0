I did, and it didn't say anything.

Turns out I misremembered the CodingStyle as having a corner case where it doesn't. I'll fix the style - I dislike the above, too ;)

Yes and no. Now that you mention it - the LTC2990 can be at four addresses (0x4c - 0x4f), and there are jumpers (solder pads) on the PCB to select its address. Shall I add all 4 addresses to the array?

It's also possible that there is no LTC2990 at all (because it's hard to solder at home), and that's why we need to probe for it first. I believe i2c_new[_client]_device doesn't do probing, but rather assumes the device to be there. Correct?
