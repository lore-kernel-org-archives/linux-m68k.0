Yes, that fits the same category.

I guess what happened is that some variables are traditionally marked
as volatile although they shouldn't be, and most architectures have
adapted their bitops to make the warnings go away. If you see more
warnings of that kind, it's probably fine to just do the same on m68k.
The volatile modifier doesn't really hurt in this case.
