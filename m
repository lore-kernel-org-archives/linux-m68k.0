I don't object to removing it. On the contrary, in a previous message I 
also questioned adding this particular 'fallthrough' (though I did 
recommended adding a different one).

In general, there's no way to predict which static checkers are going to 
complain about any given line of code. They don't all agree about 
correctness and they are a moving target, just like fashion or reviewers' 
preferred code styles.

The 'fallthrough' that I recommended was merely the one that seemed to 
improve readability to my eyes (and not to some algorithm). I didn't 
actually run "make C=1 W=1" or any other checker.
