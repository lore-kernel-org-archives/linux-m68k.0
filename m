My mistake - I was considering options to allow IDE to share the
interrupt, without the complexities of the old locking scheme.

I hadn't considered that. Can PDMA for Falcon SCSI coexist with
interrupt-using DMA for TT SCSI in the same driver (i.e. as runtime
options)? How much overhead and latency would polling for DMA completion
add?

atari_irq_pending(IRQ_MFP_FSCSI) should show the interrupt pending
condition if you want to poll for it. That's actually given me another
idea to pursue - if we can ensure the IDE interrupt handler is always
run first, and check whether the interrupt is still pending when the
SCSI or floppy interrupt handler runs and DMA has been in progress, we
should be able to avoid calling the respective handlers unnecessarily.

(The output of atari_irq_pending() does not directly reflect the status
of the MFP IRQ inputs - that would require testing bits in
st_mfp.par_dt_reg instead. )

If we manage to separate interrupt sharing from DMA access locking, IDE
would not need to take part in the locking. I'm assuming that IDE can
cope with spurious interrupts and won't get confused by a SCSI interrupt.

Point taken - that problem still remains but is already being detected
(though not properly handled IIRC),

I think it could work both ways - polling for DMA completion or avoiding
to call the SCSI interrupt handler the interrupt was caused by IDE only.
But it's indeed time to put that to the test.
