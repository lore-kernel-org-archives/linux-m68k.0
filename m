Right, Grant also made the same comment.

I agree that it won't be fully generic, because all architectures
with non-coherent DMA will have to do architecture specific setup
to get uncached mappings here. I believe that it can be generic
enough to support all architectures that have a cache-coherent PCI
bus, hence the #ifdef CONFIG_DMA_COHERENT around this function.

E.g. cris could use a one-line redirect to
asm-generic/dma-mapping-linear.h if it did not have the
special dma_get_cache_alignment function. I still would
like to find a better way to handle this one than to
redefine the function.

hehe, sure. I copied the dma_debug stuff from sh, the comments
from avr32 and the dma_alloc_coherent implementation from powerpc,
so I missed this one.

Thanks for the review.
