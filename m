Interesting, I'd expect unistd.h to be the same!

Ah, it's the restart_syscall:

Sorry, I don't know about syscall restart handling, and why it differs. Anyone
who can enlighten me?

Still, I don't see why the compiler needs to be aware of being configured for
m68k or m68knommu, so IMHO this is a very fragile test...

What are the other exported headers that differ?
