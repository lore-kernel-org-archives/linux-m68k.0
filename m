When I first wrote that code, the idea was that if a given chip
had multiple IDE ports (hardware interfaces, or hwifs for short),
then that's how it would be done.  One controller, multiple hwifs.

This was before IDE had anything to do with the SCSI subsystem,
and allowed for things like controller chips which could operate
only a single hwif at any point in time (aka. "serialized").

Nowadays, the code's be hacked beyond recognition from its original form
and intent, so who knows!  :)
