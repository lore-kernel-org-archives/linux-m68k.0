It seems to do that in i2c_del_adapter():

  device_for_each_child(&adap->dev, NULL, __unregister_dummy);


However, I'm not sure I'm supposed to do that. I went by Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices, which in "Method 2" says:

  The driver which instantiated the I2C device is responsible for destroying
  it on cleanup. This is done by calling i2c_unregister_device() on the
  pointer that was earlier returned by i2c_new_device() or
  i2c_new_probed_device().


So, what is preferred and why?


Thanks!

Max
