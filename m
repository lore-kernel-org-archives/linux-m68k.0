Yes, I've just did. Sorry it took that long.
Looks good, so
Acked-by: <Geert Uytterhoeven <geert@linux-m68k.org>

BTW, what's the plan with this series? Will you take care of it, or sho=

all arch maintainers take their parts?

There are a few more or less minor things:
  - You can remove "write" completely, as it's now superseded by
    FAULT_FLAG_WRITE in "flags",
  - Please also port the comments that were added to x86. They make
    life easier for the casual reader.

Thanks!
