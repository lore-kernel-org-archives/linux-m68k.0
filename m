No, by default it is used only for some commands (i.e. IDENTIFY,
SET FEATURES - XFER MODE).

You can find actual implementation in libata-sff.c.

Please see ata_sff_pio_task() for the main polling logic:

fsm_start:
	WARN_ON_ONCE(ap->hsm_task_state == HSM_ST_IDLE);

	/*
	 * This is purely heuristic.  This is a fast path.
	 * Sometimes when we enter, BSY will be cleared in
	 * a chk-status or two.  If not, the drive is probably seeking
	 * or something.  Snooze for a couple msecs, then
	 * chk-status again.  If still busy, queue delayed work.
	 */
	status = ata_sff_busy_wait(ap, ATA_BUSY, 5);
	if (status & ATA_BUSY) {
		spin_unlock_irq(ap->lock);
		ata_msleep(ap, 2);
		spin_lock_irq(ap->lock);

		status = ata_sff_busy_wait(ap, ATA_BUSY, 10);
		if (status & ATA_BUSY) {
			ata_sff_queue_pio_task(link, ATA_SHORT_PAUSE);
			goto out_unlock;
		}
	}

	/*
	 * hsm_move() may trigger another command to be processed.
	 * clean the link beforehand.
	 */
	ap->sff_pio_task_link = NULL;
	/* move the HSM */
	poll_next = ata_sff_hsm_move(ap, qc, status, 1);

	/* another command or interrupt handler
	 * may be running at this point.
	 */
	if (poll_next)
		goto fsm_start;
out_unlock:


ata_sff_busy_wait()'s last argument is number of 10uS waits so
first check (50uS) should be quite quick.  If device is still
busy we sleep for 2ms.  Then we quickly (100uS) busy wait and
if needed  queue delayed work (with ATA_SHORT_PAUSE == 16 ms
delay).

Overall the current heuristic looks fine and spinning should be
minimal.

Great!

BTW according to comment in arch/m68k/atari/stdma.c:

/* On the Falcon, the IDE bus uses just the ACSI/Floppy interrupt, but */
/* not the ST-DMA chip itself. So falhd.c needs not to lock the        */
/* chip. The interrupt is routed to falhd.c if IDE is configured, the  */
/* model is a Falcon and the interrupt was caused by the HD controller */
/* (can be determined by looking at its status register).              */

it should be okay to use IDE at the same time as SCSI/Floppy which
is what the new driver does (the old one is serialized operations by
ST-DMA related IRQ handling magic).

Also the comment itself may need some fixups as on Falcon it is SCSI
not ACSI (according to the earlier comment in same file) and the old
IDE host driver name is not falhd.c but falconide.c.
