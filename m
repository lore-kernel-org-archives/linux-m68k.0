The MFP interrupt in question is the same as the one used by IDE
(wired-OR of IDE, FDC and SCSI), so we would still have to figure out
where the interrupt originated. Polling instead of taking the interrupt
does not change that fundamental problem (unless I'm missing something).

That one (and the ACSI algorithm which would apply to SCSI for Falcon)
does suggest it won't be possible to peek at the sector count register
to detect end of DMA. The addendum (note 841017G) makes it clear that a
write to the DMA mode register is required to look at the status
register error bit (which might terminate DMA).

Maybe the DMA address register can be used to check for DMA completion
... it's used to check for residual or lost bytes anyway so that appears
to work. And the FDC driver does use the same strategy to check if
enough track data have been read.

Leaves the case where DMA hasn't completed but may have been aborted by
a NCR5380 interrupt. I suppose we can detect that by checking for any
change in the DMA address while repeatedly reading the DMA address
register. No change means the DMA has got stuck. Not exactly pretty but
all I can come up with.

On Falcon, the IDE interrupt is also OR'ed to the above two interrupt
lines, hence the need for including IDE in the locking scheme there.

We'll have to make sure FDC and SCSI don't clash in their DMA and
interrupt use.
