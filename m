In later Freescale/NXP ARM SoCs (i.MX and Layerscape), we
also get a lot of devices pulled over from PowerPC, with random
endianess. In some cases, the same device that had big-endian
registers originally ends up in two different ARM products and one of
them uses big-endian while the other one uses little-endian registers.

Is there a complete list of coldfire on-chip device drivers?

Looking at some of the drivers:

- drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-imx.c uses only 8-bit accesses and works either way,
  same for drivers/tty/serial/mcf.c
- drivers/spi/spi-coldfire-qspi.c is apparently coldfire-only and could use
  ioread32be for a portable to do big-endian register access.
- edma-common has a wrapper to support both big-endian and little-endian
  configurations in the same kernel image, but the mcf interrupt handler
  is hardcoded to the (normally) little-endian ioread32 function.
- drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/fec_main.c is shared between coldfire
  and i.MX (but not mpc52xx), and is hardcoded to readl/writel, and
  would need the same trick as edma to make it portable.
