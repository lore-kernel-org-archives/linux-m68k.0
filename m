Quite a few of the m68k asm headers are identical to the asm-generic
versions. So switch to using them where ever we can.

v2 is rebased on top of 3.7-rc3.
v3 keep those in uapi/asm in uapi/asm (not moved to asm-generic)

All defconfigs build. Run tested on ColdFire (with and without MMU) and on
ArranyM.
