As I said, it's not wrong for them to have a volatile qualifier in the
argument list. However, there should also not be the need for the
qualifier in any of the callers, because the bitops only work if
all accesses to the data are done through bitops functions, and that
means that the qualifier on the variable is completely meaningless.
