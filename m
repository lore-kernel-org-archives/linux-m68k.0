I've reviewed the first bit and it looks fine (so far to me).
Two related bugs:
1) dma_alloc_coherent() is not respecting the coherent_dma_mask field
in device.h:struct device.
2) dma_map_single() is not respecting dma_mask in struct pci_dev (and
pointer from struct device).

Key here is the DMA is coherent, bi-directional, and the DMA address fi=
t in
the coherent_dma_mask. "uncached/unbuffered" is one way of doing this a=
nd
is how we've implemented "DMA coherency" on parisc platforms that don't
have an IOMMU (which all have PA1.1 CPUs) - see arch/parisc/kernel/pci-=
dma.c

And I'll confess pci-dma.c doesn't implement support for coherent_dma_m=
ask .
AFAIK, the targeted platforms have < 4GB of RAM and only PCI devices.
ISA support is completely missing and is the only case this class of ma=
chines
need coherent_dma_mask support.
