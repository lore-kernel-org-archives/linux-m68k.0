That's hardly surprising because SA1100 is a SoC, SA110 is just a CPU,
containing no peripherals at all.

EBSA110 only has one usable timer, which must be programmed to produce
a regular timer tick to the OS: it's no good trying to double up the
clocksource and a periodic clockevent onto one counter register - the
clock source will see the same timer value +/- interrupt latency, and
in any case it won't wrap in a power-of-2 manner.

This breaks the assumptions behind the clocksource and timekeeping
code, which are that we have a timer that wraps in a power-of-2
manner, and which takes much longer than the desired period to wrap.

I think RiscPC may be convertable as there are two timers, and I think
the second timer is unused (so could be programmed to the requirements
of a clocksource) but is there much reason to bother given the EBSA110?
I think there isn't.
