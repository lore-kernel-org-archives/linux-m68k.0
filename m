Skipping register notes is fine.  Prohibiting ptrace access to any
regsets of worker threads is interesting.  I think that was tried and
shown to confuse gdb.  So the conclusion was just to provide a fake set
of registers.

Which has appears to work up to the point of dealing with architectures
that have their magic caller-saved optimization (like alpha and m68k),
and no check that all of the registers were saved when accessed.  Adding
a dummy switch stack frame for the kernel threads on those architectures
looks like a good/cheap solution at first glance.

That is where I thought we were.  Thanks for confirming that.
