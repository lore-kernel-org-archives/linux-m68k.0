Yes, that is right.

There is a number of common hardware modules that Freescale have
used in the ColdFire SoC parts and in their ARM based parts (iMX
families). The ARM parts are pretty much always little endian, and
the ColdFire is always big endian. The hardware registers in those
hardware blocks are always accessed in native endian of the processor.

So the address range checks are to deal with those internal
hardware blocks (i2c, spi, dma, etc), since we know those are
at fixed addresses. That leaves the usual endian swapping in place for
other general (ie external) devices (PCI devices, network chips, etc).

Makes sense.
