As there's no cover letter, I'm giving my (mostly general) comments in a
reply to this patch.

No include guards in the newly added header files?

This new file will conflict with arch/m68k/include/asm/Kbuild, which has:

    generic-y += kdebug.h

What about putting the dummy arch_breakpoint() in include/asm-generic/kdebug.h
instead, like

    #ifndef arch_breakpoint
    static inline void arch_breakpoint(void)
    {
    }
    #endif

Architectures providing their own version have to #define arch_breakpoint.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
