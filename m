I had to look a bit, but I found it. The apne driver doesn't use the
normal PCMCIA infrastructure at all. There is a custom Amiga PCMCIA
thing found in arch/m68k/amiga/pcmcia.c. This could complicate things
if we are able to use the common PCMCIA code for trex and try to
build a kernel with both that and amiga/pcmcia + apne.

At least it does sound like the io macros won't be an issue.
