All architectures start with KERNEL_DS, otherwise the first couple of system
calls within kernel_init() would all fail and the system wouldn't boot.

I "fixed" s390, so it should survive an early switch to USER_DS and a
subsequent failing user space access now.

Such a patch exists already (bottom of message):
