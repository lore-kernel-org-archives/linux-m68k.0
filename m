I performed a search on my side too (checking configurations options 
which select GENERIC_GPIO but not ARCH_REQUIRE_GPIOLIB) and found the 
same list. This takes some time btw - many platforms use this combo to 
make GPIO support optional. Can I ask how you figured out these two archs?

I'd assume the overhead induced by forcibly compiling GPIOlib is 
neglectable, but let's make sure this is ok indeed - Mike, Geert, would 
you mind if selecting GENERIC_GPIO enforced GPIOlib to be compiled in, 
effectively making it mandatory to implement the generic GPIO interface 
using GPIOlib? Both your implementations support GPIOlib already, but 
can also work without it, and that would make that possibility obsolete.

AFAICT these all implement an inline path that bypasses GPIOlib when the 
GPIO number is known at compile time, for faster bitbanging I presume. 
It should be totally harmless to keep them. Unfortunately, I don't think 
it would be possible to have a similar trick using handlers.

Thanks,
Alex.
