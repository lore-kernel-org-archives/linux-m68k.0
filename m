On ARM, we used to use socketcall exclusively.  We've since added all
the direct socket and IPC calls to our syscall table as part of the
big EABI shakeup.  They certainly get used on EABI, whereas OABI has
a choice.

They were made available in two stages - first the numbers were reserved
and the calls were added to the call table.  A few years later, we
exposed the syscall numbers in unistd.h.

It's now been almost 4 years since this was done, and there have been
no bug reports.
