A m68k-uclinux- gcc will. From a gcc-4.2.4

   m68k-uclinux-gcc -E -dM /tmp/foo.h | grep -i linux

   #define __linux 1
   #define __linux__ 1
   #define __uClinux__ 1
   #define __gnu_linux__ 1
   #define linux 1

(I think that is one of the very few differences of m68k-linux
over m68k-uclinux...)

I would rather just have a m68k-linux myself, and not have a
separate m68k-uclinux toolchain.

Greg
