Aha, that makes perfect sense. Now I finally understand the exact nature
of this problem.

The one reason I've seen is that converting to generic clockevents
often makes it simple to also introduce a delay timer at the same time
by just reusing the clocksource timer for it, and that saves the boot-time
loop calibration. (The MOXA ART and Aspeed saw this when I unified
the Faraday timers.)

But in general no.
