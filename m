Thanks!

I had a quick look at the code, but I'm not feeling sufficiently familiar with
the (g)libc interaction to cook up a patch dropping ipc_parse_version() from
direct ipc calls.

Should I postpone wiring up the direct ipc syscalls on m68k (and thus renumber
__NR_membarrier) until the above is resolved, or can they go in in v4.3?

I guess the same is true for x86-32.

Thanks again!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
