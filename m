Yes, this seems confirmed also from the drivers/dma/fsl-edma-common.h

/*

 * For the big-endian IP module, the offset for 8-bit or 16-bit registers

I can list those i worked on

i2c-imx.c
spi-fsl-dspi.c
mcf-edma.c + fsl-edma.common.c
now working on a sdhci-esdhc-mcf.c

And about mcf5441x, some other drivers as usb or probably can have still 
to be enabled/mainlined.
