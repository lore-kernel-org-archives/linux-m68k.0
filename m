Hi Geert,

Thanks for your feedback!

Oh no! I missed those in the original project, in my mind it didn't have any extra hardware at all.

I only own the new board with the LTC2990, and I'm pretty sure there are more of these in circulation than the original board. So if it's okay, I'll skip the DS1620 and PCF8583.

Fair. I kept the name when I cloned i2c-elektor.c.

Also, I only wanted to reserve the first 4 bytes. Thinking about it now, it makes more sense to reserve the whole AutoConfig'd space, as I don't know whether the bus GAL maps the PCF8584 across the whole 64k repeatedly.

It sets the sensor modes in the LTC2990 and enables the three sensors listed below. I should have clarified this.

I tried to integrate this in the driver, but ltc2990 only allows reading this configuration out of a device tree. Is there a good way to fake a DT entry in the init function?
