FYI when I had to come up to speed on this in 2014 I did a writeup on my own
research:

https://landley.net/notes-2014.html#07-12-2014

The lack of a canonical "upstream" elf2flt repository was probably the biggest
problem at the time.

(There's a reason I grabbed fdpic hard and tried to make that work everywhere.)
