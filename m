Oh I definitely agree that a direct syscall is better, and I wonder in
fact if I should add new syscalls in addition to socketcall for powerpc,
for glibc to do a slow migration :-) I was just wondering about the
inconsistency for archs like us who have socketcall today, to also have
to define the syscall ...

IE. I'd rather have them all duplicated into real syscalls than some of
them only in socketcall and some on both since that will make any kind
of userspace transition even more hellish.

Cheers,
Ben.
