I was fooled by make headers_check showing no errros.
But it turns out that headers_check does not recognize
includes made with "".

So I will update the patch to include revevant *_{no,mm}.h files
in Kbuild.

Can someone with a shared (m68k/m68knommu) please check if
__uClinux__ is only set in the m68knommu case.

Use:

    touch foo.h; gcc -E -dM

to see what is defined by the compiler.
You will also need to specify if this is for m68k or m68knommu.

Thanks,
	Sam
